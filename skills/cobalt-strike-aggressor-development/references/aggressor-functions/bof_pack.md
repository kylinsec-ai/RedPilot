bof_pack

Pack arguments in a way that's suitable for BOF APIs to unpack.

#### Arguments

`$1` - the id for the Beacon (needed for unicode conversions)

`$2` - format string for the packed data

`...` - one argument per item in our format string

#### Note

This function packs its arguments into a binary structure for use with &beacon_inline_execute. The format string options here correspond to the BeaconData* C API available to BOF files. This API handles transformations on the data and hints as required by each type it can pack.

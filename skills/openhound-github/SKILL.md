# OpenHound GitHub / GitHound

Use this skill for OpenHound GitHub OpenGraph query design and attack-path triage with GitHound-collected GitHub data.

## Required context

- Authorized GitHub enterprises, organizations, and repositories.
- Whether GitHound/OpenHound GitHub schema/data is loaded.
- Whether SAML external identity, SCIM, Azure, Okta, or other linked identity data is available.
- Target repositories, teams, users, actions policies, environments, secrets, PATs, apps, or cloud identities.

## Workflow

1. Read `../../references/docs/bloodhound-query-methodology.md`, `../../references/docs/openhound-github-methodology.md`, and `../../references/docs/collector-source-index.md`.
2. If SCIM, SAML, SSO, Okta, Azure, or external identity links are relevant, read `../../references/docs/scim-methodology.md` and inspect the small GitHound examples under `../../references/examples/githound/samples/`.
3. Search `../../references/query-indexes/openhound-github.md` and `../../references/examples/example-cypher.md` for a saved-query starting point.
4. Inspect the referenced JSON snapshot and adapt parameters safely.
5. Preserve `GH_` labels/edges, `SCIM_*` bridge labels/edges, and permission-inheritance path shape.
6. Separate posture checks from attack paths and list false-positive validation steps.

## Common pivots

- GitHub users/teams to repo admin/write access.
- Branch protection bypass and dangerous branch permissions.
- Actions policy, SHA pinning, workflow dispatch, runner, and secret exfiltration risk.
- Secrets/variables scope exposure and secret scanning alert metadata.
- App installations and PATs with broad repository access.
- GitHub OIDC to Azure federated identity credentials.
- External identities without SCIM and SCIM-provisioned identities mapped to GitHub users/teams.

## Output

Use the shared output contract from `$bloodhound-query` and include GitHub-specific caveats such as enterprise/org coverage, Actions settings collection, SAML/SCIM data availability, secret metadata limitations, and linked-identity confidence.

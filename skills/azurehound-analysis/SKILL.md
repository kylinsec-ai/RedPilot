# AzureHound

Use this skill for AzureHound / Entra ID BloodHound query design and attack-path triage.

## Required context

- Authorized Azure tenants/subscriptions and whether AzureHound/Entra collection is present.
- Known object IDs, tenant names, privileged roles, subscriptions, or resource scopes.
- Hybrid collection availability when paths cross AD, GitHub, Okta, or SCIM.

## Workflow

1. Read `../../references/docs/bloodhound-query-methodology.md` and `../../references/docs/azurehound-methodology.md`.
2. Search `../../references/query-indexes/azurehound.md` for a matching Query Library pattern.
3. Inspect the snapshot and confirm `AZ*` labels/edges before adapting.
4. Use exact `objectid` filters when possible and bound broad tenant paths.
5. Explain each path segment by platform and collector source.

## Common pivots

- Users/groups/service principals to privileged Entra roles.
- App owners, app role assignments, credentials, and Graph API permission edges.
- Managed identities to Azure resources.
- Subscription/resource group/VM/Key Vault control paths.
- AAD/Entra Connect and synced identity bridges.
- GitHub/OIDC or Okta/SCIM hybrid paths when data is present.

## Output

Use the shared output contract from `$bloodhound-query` and include Azure-specific caveats such as display-name ambiguity, tenant-scale query cost, non-traversable Graph API edges, and collector freshness.
